Problem is: incoming call on DN3 from Response Group with impersonated CPN. DN3 receives a call from CPN delegated by Response Group and answers the call. After call is established, in Skype for Business roaster DN3 see Conference Service Portal instead of CPN.

 

Problem cannot be fixed because Response Group is Skype for Business B2B application and after answer on Response Group member, answered Response Group member calls back by itself to call originator - in our case the call originator is Conference Service Portal. Call is established by Skype for Business Client itself - there is no possibility to make Skype for Business Client to impersonate its call destination as CPN.

This scenario must be described as LIMITATION with workaround.

the possible reason for such behaviour on your side is: no access rights for sip:MakeCall@*genesys.com* to call RG endpoints - maybe @genesys.com is the reason. At first step, you could try to sip:MakeCall@*uksfb.lab*

But actually i mentioned in FDS that {color:#000000}Сaller ID must be SIP URI of existing in Skype for Business environment Endpoint{color}

i do not believe that you have sip:MakeCall@*genesys.com*  as SfB user

Could you please try again with provided info?","February 20, 2018 8:46 PM;pdodds;All the other CPN tests I've run work fine provided the value is a valid SIP URI - it doesn't matter whether it exists in CME or not.

Yes, in fact you're right and i've tested and in most cases simple fake SIP URI like sip:[blablabla@fakedomain.net|mailto:blablabla@fakedomain.net] is works fine, but(!) actually SfB makes the call with using pointed SIP URI - and it's possible situation that by some reasons call will be failed (as in your case)

So to prevent the situation that our customers are playing into game with attempts to make it works - i provided the way how it must be configured and used","February 20, 2018 9:00 PM;lgorbach;[~pauld], could you please describe your scene

sip:[102_01_u15@uksfb.lab|mailto:102_01_u15@uksfb.lab] - is agent

sip:[r_group01@uksfb.lab|mailto:r_group01@uksfb.lab] - is RG

 

sip:[102_01_u20@uksfb.lab|mailto:102_01_u20@uksfb.lab] - is it configured in CME or unmonitored?

Who answers the RG Call?  sip:[102_01_u2@uksfb.lab|mailto:102_01_u2@uksfb.lab]?

Is sip:[102_01_u2@uksfb.lab|mailto:102_01_u2@uksfb.lab] configured in CME, right?

 

Could you please make the logs for case without CPN with same actors?","February 20, 2018 9:10 PM;pdodds;Hi Leon,

I've already provided logs without CPN in the first attachment.

Ignoring the genesys.com scenario, this is what you'll find in the logs.

As mentioned in the description, u1 and u2 are members of RG r_group01. As you can see in the logs, all these devices are configured in CME.

From cpn_call_to_RG_logs.zip:
* ConnID 01b402b85cca3001
* Monitored device u15 makes call to RG r_group01 without using CPN
* Call is delivered to RG member u2
* u2 is able to answer the call

From LYNC-3483_additional_logs.zip
* ConnID 01b402b85da46001
* Monitored device u15 makes call to RG  r_group01 - CPN ""sip:102_01_20@uksfb.lab"" is passed as u20 is configured in CME as requested
* Call is delivered to RG member u1 and is immediately released
* Call is delivered to RG member u2 and is immediately released
","February 20, 2018 9:34 PM;lgorbach;It looks like the problem is that:

Calling by B2B with CPN to Response Group with Monitored members causes unexpected behaviour

Will investigate.

At least - we definitely can live with that limitation because using of CPN for monitored RG makes not so much sense","February 21, 2018 2:50 PM;lgorbach;Problem scenario is:

- Response Group contains monitored DN3

- CPN is unknown SIP URI

- B2B call to Response Group

Problem is: incoming call on DN3 from Response Group with impersonated CPN is interpreted as incoming direct call - and handled by Connector.

Problem cannot be fixed because Response Group is Skype for Business B2B application and it's impossible to pass custom headers in call from Response Group to Response Group Member.

This scenario must be described as LIMITATION with workaround.

Workaround: CPN should point to Application Endpoint configured in CME as Routing Point","June 25, 2018 3:58 PM;jakobe;Changed priority to low

Due to option 'rq-expire-tout' being set to 0 and particularities of timer implementation in common lib the use of timeout with value 0 leads to immediate execution of the timer - without giving control to the T-Server.

In order to prevent unresponsiveness of T-Server the TS will check if option value provided is 0 and will use 1 msec - this would allow T-Server to use small timeout in registration to remote services but without being looped.
